ejs can access only those variables which are passed by res.render() 
HTML forms can support only GET and POST.

Until you introduce method-override (later):

EDIT & DELETE must also use POST

That’s how real apps do it internally.

We use redirect after delete because the data has changed.
We use render only when we already have the correct data in hand.

Think of it like this:

“For every document in MongoDB, EJS creates a small HTML block.”

That block contains:

Data → item.title, item.content

Actions → /edit/item._id, /delete/item._id

So when you add or delete a post:

The database changes

Homepage re-renders

Loop updates automatically

When you use:

app.use(express.static('public'));

Express treats public as the root for static files.

That means:

File location	URL path
public/css/style.css	/css/style.css  in linking css files 

👉 You NEVER write /public in the browser path.

HTTP is stateless.

That means:

Request 1 → server forgets

Request 2 → server has no memory

So when a user logs in, how does the server remember them?

👉 Sessions.

A session is:

A small server-side memory linked to a user via a cookie.

JWT Authentication setup:
To improve security, JWT access tokens will be short-lived. When they expire, the client application can use a valid refresh token to get new access tokens. This prevents the user from having to log in every time the access token expires.
